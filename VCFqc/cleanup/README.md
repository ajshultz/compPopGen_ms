### Standalone scripts for clean up and standardization of output

VCFs: bringing output from previous scripts to match snakemake output & fix filtering from snakemake to match previous scripts  

Coverage: coverage bedgraphs and histograms per BAM  

Site filtering: callable and mappable regions to annotate each VCF with filtering thresholds  

QC: filter VCFs for individual missingness and depth, site coverage and mappability, compute SNPs and callable sites per 50 kb, create sample metadata, data exploration (e.g. PCA)
