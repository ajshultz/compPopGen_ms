Error in rule genmap_index:

    output: testgenome/genmap_index

    shell:
        genmap index -F testgenome/testgenome_genomic.fna -I testgenome/genmap_index 2> testgenome/genmap_index/log.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job genmap_index since they might be corrupted:
testgenome/genmap_index
Skipped removing non-empty directory testgenome/genmap_index
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
