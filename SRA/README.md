Testing out using Entrez searches and the SRA run selector to pull down metadata for processing in R.

Procedure is to run the searches in sra_searches.txt in sequence, saving each to a new file (for simplicity, and because the SRA Run Selector has a 20k record limit).

Then, combined and analyze in R.
